Golang YAML node pipeline.

## Status

This is currently alpha, with some features still in development, and not full test coverage. We're on it! ðŸ’ª

## Example

This program does the following:
- Creates a pipeline input that just provides a YAML from a constant
  - More realistic examples would pipe YAML from a file or a stream
- Creates a pipeline of two steps:
  - Accepts only nodes whose `include` property equals `true`
  - Sends those nodes to a node channel
- Pipes nodes sent to the node channel into `stderr`

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	. "github.com/arikkfir/gstream/pkg"
	. "github.com/arikkfir/gstream/pkg/generate"
	. "github.com/arikkfir/gstream/pkg/processing"
	. "github.com/arikkfir/gstream/pkg/sink"
	. "github.com/arikkfir/gstream/pkg/types"
	"gopkg.in/yaml.v3"
	"os"
	"strings"
)

const yml = `
key: value1
include: true
---
key: value2
include: false
---
key: value3
include: true`

func main() {
    s := NewStream().
        Generate(FromReader(strings.NewReader(yml))).
        Transform(YAMLPathFilter("$[?(@.include==true)]")).
        Sink(ToWriter(os.Stdout))
    if err := s.Execute(context.Background()); err != nil {
        panic(err)
    }
}
```

This will print the following:

```yaml
key: value1
include: true
---
key: value3
include: true
```
